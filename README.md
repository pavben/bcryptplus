A futureproof way of using bcrypt for hashing passwords. Specify the hash difficulty as clock time (e.g. 300ms) based on your server's CPU and bcryptplus will automatically select the hash strength to match the given time for your machine. As common processing power goes up according to Moore's law, your hashes will automatically get stronger.
